# Impact of Precipitation on ANPP in the USDA LTAR Network

## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of precipitation (PPT) on Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) across agroecosystem types, sites, and crops within the USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network. Using data from 15 LTAR sites (1983–2022), the study models ANPP responses to precipitation, identifying patterns, thresholds, and site- or crop-specific behaviors. The analysis employs linear regression, piecewise linear regression with cyclic terms, and periodogram analysis to uncover relationships, such as precipitation explaining up to 82.7% of ANPP variation in rangelands and maize showing a 9.6-year precipitation cycle. The project aims to provide insights for ecological modeling and agroecosystem resilience under climate change.

## Features

- Models ANPP responses to precipitation using linear and piecewise linear regression with sine/cosine cyclic terms.
- Performs cycle detection via periodogram analysis to identify precipitation cycles (e.g., 9.6-year cycle for maize).
- Analyzes site-specific patterns (e.g., strong negative correlation at LCB, R² = 0.901) and crop-specific thresholds (e.g., maize ANPP peaks at ~853 mm PPT).
- Supports cluster-specific analysis, such as CPER’s strong PPT-ANPP relationship (R² = 0.829).
- Captures nonlinear effects, like switchgrass’s 20-year precipitation cycle response (R² = 0.956).

## Installation

To set up and run this Python project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Preetha-Selvaraj/LTAR_Agroecosystem_Project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd LTAR_Agroecosystem_Project
```
## Output

Results are stored as `.csv` files generated by the `select_best_model()` function, organized in three folders:

- `regression_model_results_1`
- `regression_model_results_2.zip`
- `regression_model_results_3`

These folders contain outputs for various configurations (yearly aggregate, cycle, smoothing, lags) from regression models, including linear, quadratic, piecewise linear, and spline regression.
